# GitHub üíé Gems by PrivacyTools.io

What are GitHub Gems by [PrivacyTools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/)? Open Source Software that doesn't fit the privacy topic on the main website PrivacyTools.io but are worth checking out. Most open source projects are run by privacy-minded people, anyway. From great developers for beautiful people like you.

GitHub Gems are hard to discover since they are so precious and rare, so please share them with me on Twitter if you happen to stumble upon a Gem. I will make sure to let the world know about them as soon as possible and share the love the developers have put in these tools.
